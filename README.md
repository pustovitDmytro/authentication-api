# authentication-api
NodeJs API with basic jwt authentication

## How to Install:
To install and launch project run this command in console:
```
yarn install
yarn start
```
That should start App on localhost:8080.

If you want to use live-reloading, run:
```
yarn dev
```

## Front

I also provide client [app](https://github.com/pustovitDmytro/authentication-react) (React/Redux SPA) to show how to use this api.
